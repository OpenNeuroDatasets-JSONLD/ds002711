This is the functional and structural MRI data of  the following study:

Chatzichristos, C. and Morante, M. and Andreadis, A. and Kofidis, E. and Kopsinis, Y. and Theodoridis, S. Emojis influence autobiographical memory retrieval from reading words: An fMRI-based study, Plos One, 2020

Folders are organised in subject number (e.g. sub-01). Within each folder there are subfolders with the following:

1) anat - Bravo T1-weighted structural scan
          TR 6.8 ms, TE 2.6 ms, flip angle 10o, 1.2 mm3 
          isotropic voxels, image size 512x512x280

        - Flair T2-weighted structural scan
	     TR 10 s, TE 118.608 ms, flip angle 160o, 3 mm3 
	     isotropic voxels, 256 image size 512x512x36

2) func - Functional images, 540 volumes
         TR 2 s, TE 45 ms, 
         image size 64 x 64 x 33, 4mm3 isotropic voxels



The timing for the Events are the same for every subject. The events files are in the main folder presented in the Custom (3 column format) format used from FSL.

HH	Happy word- Happy emoji events
HS	Happy word- Sad emoji events
SS	Sad word- Sad emoji events
SH	Sad word- Happy emoji events
PS	Pseudowords

In the sourcedata folder the response time of each subject to the stimuli are presented. The files generated from the software Nordic Aktiva are included. The response of each subject is annotated as "Response"
an "a" is following if he/she responded with the press of the left hand while "d" for the right hand.



The timing for the Events are the same for every subject. The annotations in the event file are the following:

HH	Happy word- Happy emoji events
HS	Happy word- Sad emoji events
SS	Sad word- Sad emoji events
SH	Sad word- Happy emoji events
PS	Pseudowords
